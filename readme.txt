Predicting the functional effects of voltage-gated potassium channel missense mutations

---

This MTL-SVM predicts the overall net functional effect of non-synonymous missense variants in voltage-gated potassium channels on ion channel function (gain-of-function, GOF; loss-of-function, LOF). It does not offer pathogenicity prediction, which should be obtained from other publicly available tools.

For additional information, please refer to GitHub (christianbosselmann), AIMe Registry (IFtQVF), the Help option of the R Shiny App interface, and the manuscript.

Training data, preprocessing pipelines and a pre-trained model object are provided for reproducibility. For any other queries, please contact me directly (see below). Happy to help!

Do:
1.) Run app.R
2.) Shiny app interface should open
3.) Enter your variant of interest (e.g., KCNA2-R294H)
4.) Runtime should be 5-10s
5.) Done.
